### Day 2: Oct 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learnt how to use NextAuth GitHub provider access token into Octokit for using GitHub's REST APIs.

**Thoughts**: I kept trying to use CSRF token for Octokit auth. And I realized Octokit require github access token. It happened because I didn't fully understand what CSRF token is.
